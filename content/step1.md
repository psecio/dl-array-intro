title: Defining Arrays
file: step1.php

The first step to using arrays in PHP is to learn about what they are and how they're defined. An array in PHP is a set of values held in a special type of variable. These values can be just about anything including:

- strings
- objects
- other arrays

In PHP, there's no need to define how many items you want in your array when you define it (as you have to do in lower level languages like C). You can just keep adding and removing values to your heart's content.

In the code example to the right, you'll see a basic array defined. In this case, it uses the square bracket shorthand notation: `[` and `]`. To PHP this is exactly the same as using `array(` and `)`, it's just shorter and easier to read.

### @todo

Now let's try adding some values to the array. To add values to the array, we just drop them in between the `[` and `]`. Go ahead and add two string values - `test1` and `test2` - to the array.
