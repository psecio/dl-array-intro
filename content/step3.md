Arrays in PHP are very powerful so it should come as no surprise that the language has a wide array of functions that you can use to manipulate them. These vary in functionality and include the ability to:

- sort arrays in several different ways
- determine the differences between two arrays
- find similar values between multiple arrays
- add and remove values from the array
- checking to see if a value is in an array

...and many, many more. If you're interested in the full list, check out [the PHP documentation for arrays](http://php.net/manual/en/ref.array.php) in the manual.
